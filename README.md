Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
I'm like a rubber ball
Baby that's all that I am to you (bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
Just a rubber ball
'Cause you think you can be true to two (bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
You bounce my heart around (you don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
If you stretch my love till it's thin enough to tear
I'll just stretch my arms to reach you anywhere
And like a rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
You bounce my heart around (you don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy
I'm like a rubber band
When on my shoulder you do tap, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy
Just a rubber band
Because my heartstrings, they just snap, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy
You go and squeeze me till I'm all aflame
(She calls you by some other guy's name)
But like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to yo
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball
